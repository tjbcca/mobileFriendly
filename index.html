            Year after year, many apes must survive in the jungle with only
            their wits and cunning. But their homes are being destroyed by
            humans intent on clearing jungles. Something must be done. By
            sending us items, we will deliver them to the apes. Whether that be
            food or tools, the apes will appreciate your contribution. We at Arm
            the Apes believe that the apes should have a chance to use our
            inventions, improving their quality of life while allowing us to
            further examine how the apes react to human creations. These
            fascinating creatures deserve your material possessions, nothing bad
            shall come of this!

            Our founder, Dr. Hugh Mann, believes that anyone should be able to
            pitch in when it comes to helping apes and help them recover from
            the damage caused by deforestation. By providing the apes with food
            and other miscellaneous items, these apes will receive some sort of
            compensation for all the forests that have been destroyed.
